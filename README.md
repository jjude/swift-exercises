# Programming exercises in Swift

When I started learning [Swift][1], I was looking for programming challenges / problems that I can work on. I didn't find any. So I am creating this series. If you are interested, subscribe via [email](http://eepurl.com/Lu3cr).

**Excercises created so far**:

1. [Divisible by 7 but not a multiple of 5][2]: Write a program to find all numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

2. [Palindrome Check][3]: Write a program to check if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like "racecar"

3. [Unique elements from arrays][4]: Write a program to make an array of unique elements from two arrays.

4. [Factorial of n][5]: Write a program to compute factorial of a number.

5. [Sort words][6]: Write a program that takes a comma separated sequence of words and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

6. [Stringify numbers][7]: Take an array of numbers, concatenate the even numbers as a string.

7. [Luh's Algorithm][8]: Validate credit card number with Luh's algorithm
