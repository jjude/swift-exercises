# Programming exercises in Swift

When I started learning [Swift][1], I was looking for programming challenges / problems that I can work on. I didn't find any. So I am creating this series. If you are interested, subscribe via [email](http://eepurl.com/Lu3cr).

Excercises created so far:

1. [Divisible by 7 but not a multiple of 5][2]: Write a program to find all numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
